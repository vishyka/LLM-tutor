# LLM-tutor

The goal of this project is to develop a generic tutor that can help guide and walk users through problems. On our first look at this problem, we first wanted to make it strictly an algorithmic problem solver, so that when given problems similar to the those on websites like LeetCode, this tutor would help the user solve them by providing hints. However, after looking at additional libraries, we wanted to expand the definition of this tutor to work for not just algorithm based problems, and instead be a generic tutor. To achieve this goal, we hope to use the Autogen library to help us dynamically create tutors. 

# Current stage
Right now, we are working on creating benchmarks for each of the agents, so that we can ensure that the models are performing as intended.
